-- v1.3.6 - 10 Mar 2014

+ Add Russian Translation

-- v1.3.5 - 25 Jan 2014

* Move from CVS to git. (what took so long)? No history was imported into the git repository due unusual 
  artifacts in the CVS repo. The CVS repo will be left for historical records only, but all new
  development will be done against the git repo.
* Change to using autotools for build (replaces custom Makefile). GTK version is now autodetected. (GTK3
  will use gsettings, GTK2 will use gconf backends as before).
+ Update the progress dialog to display friendly sizes instead of sizes in just KB.
+ Added preference to send all media files via the regular file API. Note: updated gconf/gsettings
  schema. (Android enhancement).
+ Set the progress dialog to be reused for each file being transferred.
+ Fix crash on deleting last playlist on device (GTK3).
+ Correct intermittent issue with Find operation when using Alternate Access Method and Android devices.

-- v1.3.4 - 14 Nov 2012
+ Add new preference to ignore album handling errors (Android enhancement). Note: updated gconf/gsettings
  schema.
+ Add new preference to use alternate access method for devices (uncached mode and as needed file data). 
  (Android enhancement). This may slow done gMTP as it no longer caches file information and will get file
  information each time the folder is changed. 
+ Added note for new Slackware version on gMTP home page.
* Fix date handling for some devices, ensuring date format is as per MTP v1.0 Specification Section 3.2.5.
* Modify GTK3 version to remove some depreciated GTK widgets. (Still have to consider boxes vs grid).
* WARNING: gMTP now requires libmtp 1.1.5 or newer due to the alternate access method.

-- v1.3.3 - 15 Jun 2012
* Correct handling of delete and download operation when '..' folder is selected.

-- v1.3.2 - 14 Jun 2012
* Correct Makefile to fix when building with GTK+-3.4. (Missing gthread-2.0 from pkg-config).
* Reworked pkg-config handling to respect $(PKG_CONFIG) in Makefile. (Thank you Mike Frysinger
  for pointing this out, and supplying a patch).
* Add additional error checking on connection of new devices, to hopefully avoid seg-fault with
  some very problematic devices. (Ubuntu Bug #917314, #948621, #968798, #995503)
* Fix issue with some Android 3.2 implementations and GetStorage() MTP API function. (Uses cached
  information, rather than full item rescan in some instances).
  (Debian bug #667795 - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=667795 )
* Correct German Translations. (Something went wrong in saving the file, and was changed from being
  recognised as UTF-8 to being recognised as ASCII - My apologies). 
  (Debian bug #672298 - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=672298)
* Fix FLAC file handling. (Bug only showed up in Gentoo Linux for some reason)? (Thank you 
  Martin Benirschka for helping troubleshoot this one).

-- v1.3.1 - 20 Feb 2012
* Change default to ask for Download folder upon initial installation.

-- v0.3 - 8 Jan 2010

+ gMTP is now relocatable within a filesytem. At startup, it will look at
  the command used to invoke it, and if an absolute path was used, it will
  find it's image data from that otherwise will attempt to find itself in
  the filesystem using the %PATH variable. Just make sure that you copy
  "../share/gMTP/*" to be relative to the binary if moved, otherwise no
  pretty icons. You can override any file paths with --datapath option at
  the CLI. (This was done to allow the SYSV and IPS packages to be
  relocatable). See main.c (last 2 functions) to see how this is done.
  If you know a better way that works everywhere, please let me know.
+ Added check to see if we are about to overwrite a file on the hosts
  filesystem, and prompt user to overwrite file?
