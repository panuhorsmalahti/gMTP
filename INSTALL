gMTP 1.3.6 - a basic MTP GUI client.

Requirements:
-------------

gtk+2.0 v2.4+ OR gtk+3.0 (for GNOME 3.0).
Gconf-2.0 OR GSettings (for GNOME 3.0).
libmtp
libid3tag
libflac (FLAC) v1.2+
libvorbis v1.0.1+

Installation.
-------------

gMTP build can auto-detect the version of GTK to use, and build appropriately.

Typically, a user can:
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

And gMTP will be installed into /usr/local/

To manually select the GTK version to build with, the following ./configure
options are available:

--with-gtk2 - Build with GTK2 and gconf
--with-gtk3 - Build with GTK3 and gsettings

To override installation location, use the --prefix option, and compiler
selection may be made using environment variables as passed to ./configure.

eg. to use Solaris Studio on Solaris 11, (and as long as the compiler is in our path)
$ CC=cc ./configure 

On all systems, the application should build using the native version of Make, 
(There should be no requirement on GNU Make, but if the build fails, please trying
using GNU Make to build, and let me know what systems fail using the default make
installation).

Note: Solaris 10 does not ship with a PKGCONFIG file for libusb. One can be
found in this package in the 'misc' directory.
Note: libid3tag does not provide a PKGCONFIG file. One can be found in this
package in the 'misc' directory.
